# DeFi Yield Farming

This project focuses on developing a DeFi app which implements yield farming.

---
ToDos:
- Add OpenZeppelin Contracts to minimize risks.
- Develop a new feature to keep track of the rewards.
- Implement a method to withdraw the rewards automatically when certain conditions are met (it is triggered manually in the current version).

## Theory

### What is yield farming?

At its core, yield farming is a process that allows cryptocurrency holders to lock up their holdings, which in turn provides them with rewards.

**In brief:**

- Yield farming lets you lock up funds, providing rewards in the process.
- It involves lending out cryptos via DeFi protocols in order to earn fixed or variable interest.
- The rewards can be far greater than traditional investments, but higher rewards bring higher risks, especially in such a volatile market.
